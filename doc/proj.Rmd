Suppose you happen to have travelled through the quantum realm to a new 2016 timeline, where instead of a graduate student in 2020, your identity in the new timeline is a senior advisor of a billionare, Mr. X, who just learned that one of his business partners, Donald Trump, won the competition for a Presidency election. Never have thought of an businessman, with limited background knowledge of politics, could potentially win an election, Mr. X asks you to prepare a report to analyze this topic and discuss his possible performace as the President for the next 4 years. 

![](../figs/figure.jpg)

As a time traveller, you have the exclusive access to the entire timesteam data, which means knowledge of future events and future survey outcomes from this timeline here in 2020. With the help of these "cheats", you are now fully prepared for this exploratory journey of forming this statistical report.

### Problem 0: Knowing What is At Hand.
Understanding the data is always the first step of any analysis. Since our job is mainly to analyze how Trump wins the election and how he's going to perform during his Presidency, it is therefore worth the effort to start at recent pilots gathered beween 2016 and 2020. It is also helpful to import historical data stored as time series file to help provide in a larger scale how do Presidents generally perform. 

<br>

<!-- Load Data -->
```{r, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ts_data = read_sav("../data/cdf_ts/anes_timeseries_cdf.sav") 
p20 = read_sav("../data/2020_Pilot/anes_pilot_2020ets_sav.SAV")
p19 = read_sav("../data/2019_Pilot/anes_pilot_2019.sav")
p18 = read_sav("../data/2018_Pilot/anes_pilot_2018.sav")
p16 = read_sav("../data/2016_Pilot/anes_pilot_2016.sav")

#Number of entries included
n_vals = unique(c(names(p16), names(p18), names(p19), names(p20), names(ts_data))) %>% length()
n_entries = sum(nrow(p16), nrow(p18),nrow(p19),nrow(p20),nrow(ts_data))

print(paste0("Total response entries: ", n_entries, ", total surveyed unique variables: ", n_vals, ". "))
```

<br>

It soon became obvious that in pilot surveys, many people tend to answer questions not serious/honest enough, or the responder might not even be a registered voter. For any of the above reasons, those participated dishonestly or not eligable would be excluded from this analysis so that it can be as persuasive to the boss as possible, it is first and foremost necessary to remove distrating inputs. 

For the time series data, since it consists of data no later than 2016, and honesty was not a question on the list, we will just exclude those not eligible to vote.

<br>

```{r, echo=T}
ts_data_0 = ts_data %>% filter(VCF0701 == 2 | VCF0737 == 2)
p20_0 = p20 %>% filter(serious %in% c(4,5), reg1 %in% c(1,2))
p19_0 = p19 %>% filter(serious %in% c(4,5),
                       reg1a %in% c(1,2) | reg1b %in% c(1,2))
p18_0 = p18 %>% filter(nonserious %in% c(1,2),
                       honest %in% c(4,5),
                       reg %in% c(1,2))
p16_0 = p16 %>% filter(reg == 1)

neliminated_p = mean(1 - nrow(p16_0)/nrow(p16),
                   1 - nrow(p18_0)/nrow(p18),
                   1 - nrow(p19_0)/nrow(p19),
                   1 - nrow(p20_0)/nrow(p20),
                   1 - nrow(ts_data_0)/nrow(ts_data)) %>% round(digits = 4)
rm(ts_data, p20, p19, p18, p16)
print(paste0("Average percentage of invalid entries removed: ", neliminated_p * 100,"%."))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
rm(neliminated_p,n_vals, n_entries)
```

With 12.83% of the non-relavent data removed, those entries left should provide a more precise and compelling findings to this anslysis.

### Problem 1: Knowing the Most Important Problem Nationwide.
It is common sense that to get more votes, the candidate generally address a strong problem solving skills to the American people to show that he can solve the most important problem on their lists. Thus it became clear that the first question to go on this report is the most important one. 

|Code|Category|
|--:|:--|
|1|AGRICULTURAL|
|2|ECONOMICS; BUSINESS; CONSUMER ISSUES|
|3|FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND NATIONAL DEFENSE|
|4|GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONING|
|5|LABOR ISSUES|
|6|NATURAL RESOURCES|
|7|PUBLIC ORDER|
|8|RACIAL PROBLEMS|
|9|SOCIAL WELFARE|


```{r, echo=FALSE, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=F}
ts_data_0 %>% filter(!is.na(ts_data_0$VCF0875)) %>% 
  select(Year = "VCF0004", Category = "VCF0875") %>% 
  group_by(Category, Year) %>% summarise(vot = n(), cat = as.factor(Category)) %>%
  filter(cat %in% seq(0,9,1)) %>% ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = Year, y = vot, fill = cat), stat = "identity") + 
  labs(title = "Most Important Problems based on historical data",
       y = "Vote Counts", fill = "Category") + theme_light()
```

As can be observed, before 1970, the dominant problem existing in the U.S. are foreign affair issues, but has switched to mainly economics, business and consumer issues in the 1970s as economy grows vastly in that period. Meanwhile, social werfare has increased its count of shares and has became the most important problems in existance since late 1990s. 

To conclude, there seems like a trend that underlying social issues is the most important problem that a President candidate should try to solve. To validate the guess, we shall look at some more recent data. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
stopwords = as_tibble(c("i", "me", "my", "myself", "we", "our", "ours", "ourselves", "you", "your", "yours", "yourself", "yourselves", "he", "him", "his", "himself", "she", "her", "hers", "herself", "it", "its", "itself", "they", "them", "their", "theirs", "themselves", "what", "which", "who", "whom", "this", "that", "these", "those", "am", "is", "are", "was", "were", "be", "been", "being", "have", "has", "had", "having", "do", "does", "did", "doing", "a", "an", "the", "and", "but", "if", "or", "because", "as", "until", "while", "of", "at", "by", "for", "with", "about", "against", "between", "into", "through", "during", "before", "after", "above", "below", "to", "from", "up", "down", "in", "out", "on", "off", "over", "under", "again", "further", "then", "once", "here", "there", "when", "where", "why", "how", "all", "any", "both", "each", "few", "more", "most", "other", "some", "such", "no", "nor", "not", "only", "own", "same", "so", "than", "too", "very", "s", "t", "can", "will", "just", "don", "should", "now"))
```


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
mip19 = p19_0$mip %>% 
  strsplit(split = " ") %>% unlist() %>% tolower() %>% as_tibble() %>%
  anti_join(stopwords) %>% count(value) %>% arrange(desc(n))
mip19
mip19 %>% with(wordcloud(value, n, max.words = 70, min.freq = 1,
                         random.order = F, rot.per = 0.3, 
                         use.r.layout = T, random.color = F, 
                         colors = brewer.pal(9, "Set1")))

rm(mip19, stopwords)
```

What's shown above is a wordcloud generated from text entries from the 2019 pilot surbey. It shows that in 2019 President Trump and his addressed issues are what being considered "the most important problems in this country". Since the mentioned *Healthcare* and *Immigration* issues are still social issues, it is likely to say that President Trump didn't performed well in solving social problems. we must verify that by looking at people's opinions about how he's doing his job so far.

***

### Problem 2: Knowing People's Thoughts for the Current President As Well As Their Needs.
*Time Series Data*: First let's examine how approved Presidents generally get historically. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
appr_ts = ts_data_0 %>% select(year = VCF0004, approve = VCF0450, strength = VCF0451) %>% na.omit() %>% group_by_all() %>% summarise(count = n())

pred_appr = appr_ts %>% filter(approve == 1) %>% mutate(strength = factor(strength, levels = c(1,2,8), labels = c("strong", "weak", "no idea"))) 

pred_appr %>% ggplot(aes(x = year, y = count)) + geom_point(aes(color = strength)) + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = T, fullrange = T) + labs(title = "Presidents' Job Approval Count", x="Year", y="Job Approval Counts") + theme_light()

lm(count ~ year, data = pred_appr) %>% summary()

pred_disappr = appr_ts %>% filter(approve == 2) %>% mutate(strength = factor(strength, levels = c(4,3,8), labels = c("strong", "weak", "no idea"))) 

pred_disappr %>% ggplot(aes(x = year, y = count)) + geom_point(aes(color = strength)) + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = T, fullrange = T) + labs(title = "Presidents' Job Disapproval Count", x = "Year", y = "Job Disapproval Counts") + theme_light()

lm(count ~ year, data = pred_disappr) %>% summary()


rm(pred_appr, pred_disappr, appr_ts)
```

From historical data, both approval and disapproval rates of the Presidents shown a growing trend over the years that is similar in comparison under linear modelling. But the disapproval count has a greater rate of incline compared to the approval rate, meaning more people are disapproving the President every data year. Also the Thus we assume that in course of history Presidents tend to underperform than expected.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
appobama <- as.integer(p16_0$presjob) %>% as_tibble() 
p1 = appobama %>% ggplot(aes(x = value, y = ..density..)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.3, color = "white") + geom_density(color = "blue") + labs(x = "Obama's Performance 2016", y = "") + theme_light()


apptp18 <- as.integer(p18_0$apppres) %>% as_tibble() 
p2 = apptp18 %>% ggplot(aes(x = value, y = ..density..)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.3, color = "white") + geom_density(color = "blue") + labs(x = "Trump's Performance 2018", y = "") + theme_light()


apptp19 <- append(as.integer(p19_0$apppres5), as.integer(p19_0$apppres7)) %>% as_tibble() 
p3 = apptp19 %>% ggplot(aes(x = value, y = ..density..)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.3, color = "white") + geom_density(color = "blue") + labs(x ="Trump's Performance 2019", y = "") + theme_light()


apptp20 <- as.integer(p20_0$apppres7) %>% as_tibble() 
p4 = apptp20 %>% ggplot(aes(x = value, y = ..density..)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.3, color = "white") + geom_density(color = "blue") + xlim(0,9) + labs(x = "Trump's Performance 2020", y = "") + theme_light()

plot_grid(p1, p2, p3, p4)
```

**Approval density histogram plot from 2016 to 2020, with higher score indicating disapproval.**

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
dischange = tibble(year = c(2016, 2018, 2019, 2020), 
                   count = c(appobama %>% filter(value > 4) %>% nrow(),
                            apptp18 %>% filter(value > 4) %>% nrow(),
                            apptp19 %>% filter(value > 4) %>% nrow(),
                            apptp20 %>% filter(value > 4) %>% nrow())) 

dischange %>% ggplot(aes(x = year, y = count)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = T) + 
  labs(title = "Disapproval counts from recent pilot survey",
       subtitle = "The number of disapprove counts increased in recent years more steep than before",
       x = "Year", y = "Count") + 
  theme_light()
  
lm(count ~ year, dischange) %>% summary()
rm(appobama, apptp18, apptp19, apptp20, p1,p2,p3,p4,dischange)
```

<br>

As can be observed from above plots, towards an end of a Presidency period, both Obama and Trump receive much more disapproval votes from participants.

Also, although Trump had limited experience in politics, which is probabily why he wasn't quite supported at the beginning, he does prove that people do see and appreciate his efforts of hard work, which is reflected in the plot of 2019.

### Problem 3: Piecing Information Together.
So we already know that President's tend to get quite much disapproval from the public, and for President Trump immigration and health care problems seems to be donimant, is it true that solving these issues would help getting approval from the public is the next phase of this exploration.

First we need to find out how aligned are people with Trump's take on the two dominant problems. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# 2020 Data
distrump20 = p20_0 %>% select(immpres7,covidpres7,healthcarepres7) %>%
  mutate(Immigration = as.integer(immpres7),
         Covid19 = as.integer(covidpres7),
         Healthcare = as.integer(healthcarepres7)) %>% 
  select(Immigration, Covid19, Healthcare); i = 1
while(i <= nrow(distrump20)){
  if (distrump20[i,2] > 7){
    distrump20[i,2] = 4
  }
  if (distrump20[i,3] > 7){
    distrump20[i,3] = 4
  }
  i = i+1
}
distrump20 <- distrump20 %>% pivot_longer(cols = c("Immigration", "Covid19", "Healthcare"), names_to = "type", values_to = "value") %>% arrange(type)
ggplot(distrump20) + geom_density(aes(x = value, y = ..density.., color = type)) + labs(title = "2020 Important Problems Layout", subtitle = "Higher score means opposition, 4 means don't care", x = "", y = "Density", color = "Category") + theme_light() -> plot1


# 2019 Data
tphc = p19_0$hlthcare1 %>% as.integer() + 
          p19_0$hlthcare2 %>% as.integer()
tphc = tphc %>% replace_na(5)

tpimp = p19_0$immpres5 %>% as.integer(); i=1
while(i <= length(tpimp)){
  if (is.na(tpimp[i])){
    tpimp[i] <- as.integer(p19_0$immpres7)[i]
  }
  i = i+1
}
distrump19 = as_tibble(tphc) %>% mutate(cat = rep("Healthcare", length(tphc))) %>% rbind(as_tibble(tpimp) %>% mutate(cat = rep("Immigration", length(tpimp))))
ggplot(distrump19, aes(x = value, y = ..density..)) + geom_density(aes(color = cat), alpha = 0.6) + labs(title = "2019 Important Problems Layout", subtitle = "Higher score means opposition, 5 means don't care", x = "", y = "Density", color = "Category") + theme_light() -> plot2
rm(tphc, tpimp)


# 2018 Data
hc18 = round(((p18_0$acarepeal %>% as.integer())*100/7), digits = 0) %>% as.integer()
hc18 = hc18 %>% as_tibble() %>% mutate(cat = rep("Healthcare", length(hc18)))
im18 = p18_0$ftimmig %>% as.integer()
distrump18 = im18 %>% as_tibble() %>% mutate(cat = rep("Immigration", length(im18))) %>% rbind(hc18)
ggplot(distrump18, aes(x = value, y = ..density..)) + geom_density(aes(color = cat), alpha = 0.6) + labs(title = "2018 Important Problems Layout",subtitle = "Higher score means opposition, in favor of Obama Care and immigration", x = "", y = "Density", color = "Category") + theme_light() -> plot3
rm(hc18, im18)

# 2016 Data
disob2016 = as.integer(p16_0$immig_legal) %>% as_tibble()
ggplot(disob2016) + geom_density(aes(x = value, y = ..density..)) + labs(title = "2016 Immigration Appreciation Density",subtitle = "Higher score means opposition, in favor of expelling immigrants.", x = "", y = "Density") + theme_light() -> plot4

plot_grid(plot1,plot2, ncol = 1, nrow = 2)
plot_grid(plot3,plot4, ncol = 1, nrow = 2)

rm(disob2016, distrump18, distrump19, distrump20, i)
rm(plot1,plot2,plot3,plot4)

```

In 2016, when Obama was still the President, healthcare was not a big concern, thus were not included in the pilot survey. As Trump repeals the program, in 2018, 2019 and 2020 there are more people opposing the decision than favors it. As for immigration problems, we can see that in most years, people tend to favor foreign workers in the United States than to make them felons and expel to their home countries, because more people liked Obama's attitute towards immigrants in 2016, and more people opposes Trump's take in 2018. 

In 2019, since Trump really put an effort in his job, many people approved his work and supported his take on immigration. But for the year 2020, because of the pandemic, more people opposed his decision on immigration and health care. The overall shape for 2020 however, is very polarized. One interesting findings in this part is that the curve for *Covid19* approval is almost the same as the one for *Healthcare*. It is not surprising since they are closely related, but a rater interesting social phenomenon to include in the surveys. 

Based on the above analysis, it seems like although immigration is a very debatable topic, many people oppose Trump's idea of keeping them out of this country. Healthcare however, does not seem to be an imminant problem for this country. Here raises a question: since Trump shows underperformance pattern is his Presidency, and he is not the key to solving these two problems based on peoples votes, how did he win the seat? Is there any other political forces that might affect the winning of a Presidency?

***

### Problem 4: Other Political Forces
In a Presidencial compaign, the one problem candidates must solve is how to take down their opponents, and one angle of approach fair and square is to make your fame better than theirs -- that is to let people know you better than your opponents; and to examine the effect of this advocacy, we can examine some past data. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
recall_major = ts_data_0 %>% select(year = VCF0004, ans = VCF1009, meaning = VCF1009) %>% na.omit() %>% mutate(ans = as.integer(ans), meaning = labelled::unlabelled(meaning)) %>% group_by(year, meaning) %>% summarise(ans = n())
plot1 <-
  ggplot(recall_major) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = ans, color = meaning)) +
  labs(title = "Number of successful recalls of major party candidates",
       x = "Year", y = "Count", color = "Meaning") +
  theme_light() + 
  theme(legend.title = element_text(size = 10),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 7),
        legend.spacing.y = unit(5,"points"),
        legend.key.height = unit(10,"points")) 


recall_party = ts_data_0 %>% select(year = VCF0004, ans = VCF1010) %>% na.omit() %>% mutate(meaning = labelled::unlabelled(ans), ans = as.integer(ans)) %>% group_by(year, meaning) %>% summarise(ans = n())
plot2 <- 
  ggplot(recall_party) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = ans, color = meaning)) +
  labs(title = "Number of successful recalls of own/other major party candidates",
       x = "Year", y = "Count", color = "Meaning") +
  theme_light() + 
  theme(legend.title = element_text(size = 10),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 7),
        legend.spacing.y = unit(5,"points"),
        legend.key.height = unit(10,"points")) 


recall_senate = ts_data_0 %>% select(year = VCF0004, ans = VCF9067) %>% na.omit() %>% mutate(meaning = labelled::unlabelled(ans), ans = as.integer(ans)) %>% group_by(year, meaning) %>% summarise(ans = n())
plot3 <- 
  ggplot(recall_senate) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = ans, color = meaning)) +
  labs(title = "Number of successful recalls for Senate candidates",
       x = "Year", y = "Count", color = "Meaning") +
  theme_light() + 
  theme(legend.title = element_text(size = 10),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 7),
        legend.spacing.y = unit(5,"points"),
        legend.key.height = unit(10,"points")) 


recall_house = ts_data_0 %>% select(year = VCF0004, ans = VCF0976) %>% na.omit() %>% mutate(meaning = labelled::unlabelled(ans), ans = as.integer(ans)) %>% group_by(year, meaning) %>% summarise(ans = n())
plot4 <- 
  ggplot(recall_house) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = ans, color = meaning))+
  labs(title = "Number of successful recalls for House candidates",
       x = "Year", y = "Count", color = "Meaning") +
  theme_light() + 
  theme(legend.title = element_text(size = 10),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 7),
        legend.spacing.y = unit(5,"points"),
        legend.key.height = unit(10,"points")) 


plot_grid(plot1,plot2, ncol = 1, nrow = 2)
plot_grid(plot3,plot4, ncol = 1, nrow = 2)

rm(recall_house, recall_major, recall_party, recall_senate)
rm(plot1,plot2,plot3,plot4)


```

From these plots, it shows that politicians are not quite that popular, to a point that major party candidates' names ring almost no bell to most people. Whereas Senate and House candidates, although still quite low, did rang some bell for some people. Therefore, to make the name famous, it could be a good idea to make some friends at the House or Senate. With their help and support, getting more people's attention would certainly help in winning more votes. 

***

### To Conclude
What can be concluded and presented in a report to Mr. X based on the analysis?

* First of all social issues are a big part of 21st centries problem so far, as immigrants coming from all over the world. Historical and recent data have shown that most Americans hold a welcome attitute to them. So showing a stronger international cooperative techniques will certainly get more approval from the voters in the competition. 

* Second, most voters doesn't care about general healthcare, but for those do care, people dominantly favors to have a better healthcare system, as it is heavier on the density plot compared to those against it. Thus, emphasizing a better, more available healthcare systems will help getting more support. 

* Third, other political parties plays a somewhat important role in the process of compaign. Some help advocate candidate's ideas, others opposes them. As a minor tip for sucess candidates should make some, and more friends in the government, especially the Senate and the House, to help further advertise the ideas mentioned above. 

* Fourth, it is not impossible for someone from the business industry to win a Presidency compaign, and as long as the President works hard, people eventually will recognize the effort and support him.

* Lastly, it is normal for a President to get more disapproval votes than appreciation. President Trump is no exception, taking in consideration for his fair future performance, though he is not ready for the job as a President yet, he will set things right eventually. Thus it is confident to say he is a proper candidate.
