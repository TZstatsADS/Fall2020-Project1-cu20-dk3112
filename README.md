This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2020

+ Projec title: A Report To Mr. X
+ This project is conducted by Depeng Kong

+ Project summary: Suppose you happen to have travelled through the quantum realm to a new timeline, where instead of a graduate student, your identity in the new timeline is a senior advisor of a billionare, Mr. X, who just learned that one of his business rivals, Donald Trump, won the competition for a Presidency election. Never have thought of an businessman, with limited background knowledge of politics, could potentially win an election, Mr. X asks you to prepare a report analyzing this topic and predict his performaces as the President for the next 4 years. As a time traveller, you have the exclusive access to the entire timesteam data, which means knowledge of future events and future survey outcomes from this timeline here in 2020. With the help of these "cheats", you are now fully prepared for this exploratory journey of forming this statistical report.
